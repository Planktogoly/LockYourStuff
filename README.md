# LockYourStuff

## My process of creating LockYourStuff

I always start with out thinking the whole system. You should think about 
the layout of the classes and packages. 

After I planned the layout I start with coding of the core of the system. In this case
it is the LockManager class and the two commands. I started with creating the Bukkit Events and the datastructure.
When these were done I made the two commands to interact with the core system. After I was finished I 
tested it till there were no bugs left.

The core of the system is now done and I started to work on the first way to store the data. The flat files.
I started with creating the file and the loading and saving methods. Same as with the core system I tested it
till there were no bugs left.

NOTE: All the messages are in white and not styled yet.

Now the flat files are finished I created the next way to store the data. MySQL database.
I created the Database class where you find all the methods to save, load and create the table.
Same goes for this I tested it and started to go to the next task. 

Now the whole system done is we can start on styling the system and creating fancy stuff.
I started with styling all the messages and than the help menu. After that I thought of 
things that were usefull and nice to have. I added sounds, subcommands and warnings in the help menu.

The whole plugin is practically done and again I fully tested it.

As you can see I create my plugin in steps and after each step is finished I test the plugin.
